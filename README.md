# Programmable-Lights-2

Description: The goal of this project was to create a more advanced programmable lights display. This is accomplished through implementing two data registers, three states, and extending the instructions to 10 bit length. The three states in this project are sExecute1, sExecute2, and sFetch. sExecute1 loads the instructions into the source and sExecute2 then loads the instructions into the designated registers. ACC stores instructions while LR displays the instructions though lights in the animation. Another addition to this programmable lights circuit from the last project is the ability to branch. This allows there to be looping in the program. 
This project used three different files: pld2, pldrom, and pldbench. The top level entity is pld2 and pldrom stores the data for lights. pldrom holds the address and the data for the circuit. Pld2 gives the outputs: clock, reset, irview and lightsig. These two entities interact through internal signals which are PC and ROMvalue. Pld2 interacts with the pldbench through the inputs clk and reset, the outputs irview and lightsig, and the two registers ACC and LR. SCR and ACC internal signals also cause these entities to interact.
